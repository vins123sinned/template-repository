# template-repository
A template repository for all of my future projects. Featuring webpack, npm, and everything else needed to get started coding!

This template repository contains webpack and all the necessary packages need to run your site! As a template repository, it only contains the most basic stuff and other things like html-loader will have to be installed in order to reduce any unneeded packages.

And that's all, enjoy!
